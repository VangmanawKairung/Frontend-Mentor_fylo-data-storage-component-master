## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Sass/Scss

### What I learned

- Semantic HTML `<main>` : This element defines the central content of a page, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars, to improve accessibility and SEO.
- CSS properties `vertical-align` : property sets an elementâ€™s vertical position relative to its line or surrounding content, typically for inline or table-cell elements.

### Continued development

- Master CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries for layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.
- Use meaningful tags to improve accessibility and SEO.
- Explore Sass or LESS for better-organized and reusable styles.
- Implement ARIA roles, alt text, and keyboard navigation for inclusive designs.
- Test and fix styling for consistent display across major browsers.
- Use responsive images and compressed assets for faster load times.

### Useful resources
